Dear Shanto 
 
Pls find below logic for booking and reversal file :
 
For Booking file..
 
User will select corr bank name at the time of booking.
Booking file will generate one for all banks.
 
Accounting entry .
 
Dr. Corr bank accounts
Cr. Sundry accounts
 
For Reversal file..
 
User will select reversal file for the day and generate by maker checker.
There should be a window for showing the entries of the day to client accounts with ref no previously booked and date.
 
Accounting entry
 
Dr.  – Sundry accounts.
Cr.   -  Respective Client accounts
 
For Booking and Reversal there should be view screen of previously processed files .
 
Regards
Dewan
